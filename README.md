# cdn for discoverygubbio.com

this repository hosts static files used as a simple **cdn** for the website [discoverygubbio.com](https://discoverygubbio.com). it includes videos, images, scripts, and other static assets that are served directly to the website visitors for faster loading and better performance.

## how to use the cdn

files can be referenced directly from your website. examples:

**video:**
```
<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="https://gablilli.github.io/cdn/public/video_basilica.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

## deployment

to update the cdn with new files or videos:

    add new files to your local repository, keeping filenames simple (no spaces or special characters).

    stage and commit the files:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "add new cdn assets"
    ```

    pull remote changes to avoid conflicts:
    ```
    git pull origin main --rebase
    ```
    push your changes:
    ```
    git push origin main
    ```

> note: when using mp4 videos on github pages, ensure the mime type is correct. if issues occur, renaming .mp4 to .mp4v files can sometimes help.
